            I always wanted become a pilot when i was little but i later knew
            that ambition wasn't really what i wanted for my self, as a little
            kid i always loved being creative and discovering new things, but
            lets get to the point that isn't the reason i wanted to become a
            programmer and a web developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I chose to become a programmer and web developer beacause i found
            out that its just a way of life and everyone needs to learn how to
            program a computer. I wanted to know how computer works , how the
            internet works and what those crypictic letters are formed on a
            computer screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to get creative, I wanted to make a change, I wanted to
            become someone, maybe not the greatest person on earth but atleast i
            would'nt be begging around the streets.
          </p>
          <p>
            When scroll through the web i get fascinated how they are created, I
            always thought they were just there i never even know what the web
            was, I never knew what a programming language was, then one day i
            saw a friend of mine with a laptop and i asked him
            <em>"are you a yahoo boy"</em> he replied
            <em>"no i'm not, I'm a programmer"</em> he said, and i had to look
            up what that meant and that was how i got insipired to being a
            programmer and a web developer and ever since it's just been my
            dreams.

          <p>
            In the next five years i still hope to be doing what i do best
            <em>"coding"</em> by the grace of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the next five years i hope to have gotten better at what i do
            best, maybe my dreams of being a great person like
            <strong>Mark Zukerberg</strong> or even
            <strong>Bill Gates</strong> or even the Ceo of a company or even
            work as a developer in big companies like <strong>Google</strong>,
            <strong>Amazon</strong> or even <strong>Twitter</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I always put my every ideas i have into work and i believe doing
            that makes me better, <em>"pratice makes perfect"</em> I believe
            learning is a key factor to achieving what you want, without that i
            believe it doesn't make you any better and never to young to achieve
            you life goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the next five years i believe i would be somewhere better chasing
            my dreams and working hard to make a living, working hard to someone
            better, I feel like almost nothing can stop me from achieving what i
            want except <strong>God</strong>, so in summary of all i would be in
            a better state in the next five years.
