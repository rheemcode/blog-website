                    I always wanted become a pilot when I was little but I later knew
                    that ambition wasn't really what I wanted for my self, as a little
                    kid I always loved being creative and discovering new things, but
                    lets get to the point that isn't the reason I wanted to become a
                    Programmer and a Web Developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose to become a Programmer and Web Developer beacause i found
                    out that its just a way of life and everyone needs to learn how to
                    program a computer. I wanted to know how computer works , how the
                    internet works and what those crypictic letters are formed on a
                    computer screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to get creative, I wanted to make a change, I wanted to
                    become someone, maybe not the greatest person on earth but atleast I
                    would'nt be begging around the streets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I scroll through the Web I get fascinated how they are created, I
                    always thought they were just there I never even know what the Web
                    was, I never knew what a programming language was, then one day I
                    saw a friend of mine with a laptop and I asked him
                    <em>"are you a yahoo boy"</em> he replied
                    <em>"no I'm not, I'm a Programmer"</em>, and I didn't know what that meant so I had to look it
                    up and that was how I got insipired to being a
                    Programmer and a Web Developer and ever since it's just been my
                    dreams.
